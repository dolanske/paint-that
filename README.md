## paint-that ##

A javascript application I started to learn and improve in js and <canvas>. As I progress I will update it with new features.

To-do:
    - add HEX manual color input
    - add R,G,B labels to the rgb sliders
    - add brushSize slider
    - replace button texts with icons
    - make tool strip more compact
    - change slider circle color
